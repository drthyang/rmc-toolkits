# Development Log

Chronological record of notable changes, newest first. For current architecture and conventions see
[AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md); for forward plans see [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

## Unreleased

Figure export + axis labels:

- Added per-figure **Save** controls. Dashboard charts (inline SVG) export as **PNG** (raster) or
  true-vector **SVG**; the KDE/3D panels (canvas + WebGL) export **PNG** at native or **3×**
  resolution. The earlier raster-PDF attempt was dropped — a PDF of a chart isn't true vector, and
  SVG is the proper vector format (convertible to PDF offline if needed).
- Added **Save all figures** in the dashboard's *Loaded N plot files* header. It bundles every
  visible chart into a single `.zip` (PNG or SVG), avoiding the browser's multi-download blocking.
- Added supporting modules: `figureExport.js` (SVG/canvas rasterization + standalone-SVG
  serialization with inlined computed styles), a shared `SaveMenu` component, and a dependency-free
  store-method ZIP writer (`zipArchive.js`, with CRC-32).
- High-resolution panel export re-renders the same drawing onto a 3× offscreen canvas (KDE slice,
  slab) or re-renders the Three.js scene at a higher pixel ratio (`preserveDrawingBuffer`), so the
  output is genuinely higher-resolution rather than upscaled.
- Gave proper vertical-axis labels to plots that previously showed a generic `data`: PDF/partials →
  `G(r)`, x-ray/neutron S(Q) → `S(Q)`, Bragg → `Intensity`. Applied in both the Flask
  `/api/plot/data` endpoint and the browser static-mode parser.

EXAFS and large-structure display update:

- Added EXAFS plot-kind detection for `*-EXAFS-*_Q_OUTPUT.csv` and `*-EXAFS-*_R_OUTPUT.csv` in both
  the Python package and browser static mode.
- Added `read_exafs_csv`, which handles Q-output files with a descriptive title row before the column
  header and R-output files with real/imaginary/modulus transform columns.
- Added backend and frontend chart labels for EXAFS:
  - Q-space: `k (Å^{-1})` vs `χ(k) k²`.
  - R-space: `r (Å)` vs `FT[χ(k) k²]`.
- Added EXAFS file badges/order in the dashboard and tests for parser, plot metadata, file listing,
  and `/api/plot/data`.
- Raised the structure endpoint and Structure page point limits to 1,000,000 and raised the Slab In
  Cell canvas draw cap to match, so moderate structures such as `data/RMC/snao.rmc6f` render all
  returned atoms instead of every other point.

## v0.1.0 — 2026-06-21 (first tagged release)

First public, releasable version: the reusable Python package, Flask API, interactive dashboard,
server-side + browser (WebGPU/CPU) KDE, and Three.js structure viewer with a draggable slice band.

Release engineering added in this version:

- **License:** added an MIT `LICENSE`.
- **Packaging:** added `pyproject.toml` so `rmc_toolkits` is pip-installable (`pip install -e .`) and
  exposes `rmc_toolkits.__version__`.
- **CI:** added `.github/workflows/tests.yml` — runs the Python test suite plus frontend lint/build
  on every push and PR to `main`.
- **Tests:** sample-data-backed tests now skip cleanly when the gitignored GNSe example dataset is
  absent, so the suite is green on a fresh clone and in CI (17 run, 16 skip without the sample).

## 2026-06-21 — Draggable slice band + structure-view color work

- **Slab In Cell drag-to-move slice.** Users can now grab the highlighted band in the *Slab In Cell*
  panel and drag it along the slice axis to set the slice position (`zCenter`) live; thickness is
  unchanged. Implemented by adding an `invert()` to `makePlaneMapper` (recovers plane coordinates
  from a screen point), publishing the band geometry each render into `slabGeometryRef`, and wiring
  pointer handlers on the slab canvas (`grab`/`grabbing` cursors, pointer capture,
  `touch-action: none`).
- **Bug fix:** the drag listeners initially never attached — the effect used `[]` deps but the slab
  canvas only renders after a structure loads (`{structure && ...}`), so `slabCanvasRef` was null at
  mount. Fixed by depending on `[structure]`. Verified end-to-end against `data/5K_try1`: drag moved
  SLICE 0.39 → 0.709 with the band and in-slab atoms updating.
- Earlier in the day: gave each element a distinct color across the slab and 3D views, added a shared
  atom color legend above the structure views, and relocated the atom badges.

## 2026-06-19 — WebGPU-accelerated browser KDE

- Moved the static-mode density-map hot loop (`O(grid² · samples)`, up to ~400M `exp()` per slice)
  onto the GPU. Each grid cell is independent → one WebGPU compute-shader invocation per cell.
- Added `workers/gpuKde.js`: inline WGSL shader, lazily-cached adapter/device init, `computeDensityGpu`
  (writes buffers, dispatches, reads back via `mapAsync`, reshapes to the same `density[y][x]` grid as
  the CPU path), and a `shouldUseGpu` work-size heuristic.
- Refactored `localKdeWorker.js` into `computeDensityCpu` + a GPU-or-CPU branch; made `computeKde`
  and `onmessage` async. Same `{ id, result }` message shape, so `StructurePage.jsx` needed no
  changes (its request-`id` guard already drops stale replies). Result carries `backend: 'gpu'|'cpu'`.
- GPU used only when `grid·grid·samples >= 2_000_000`; init attempted once per worker and cached.
- **Robustness is the design point:** missing `navigator.gpu`, no adapter, device/shader error, lost
  device, or sub-threshold work all fall back to the JS loop with identical output; no GPU failure
  surfaces through `worker.onerror`.
- Verified (Chromium/Metal): GPU(f32) vs CPU(f64) parity ~1.7e-6 relative across grids 16/120/260;
  density step ~59× faster at grid 120 and ~107× faster at grid 260. Still subsamples to 6000 slab
  points and uses f32 — a visualization path, not a substitute for server-side SciPy KDE.

## 2026-06-18 — Live Data and loaded-file controls

- Added optional Live Data monitoring for the local Flask dashboard: polls the selected folder for
  supported-file changes and refreshes metadata/charts without a manual reload.
- Added file mtime + size to `/api/files` so the frontend can detect changes cheaply.
- Added a collapsed `Loaded N plot files` panel; expanding shows detected files as badges that can
  hide/show their chart.
- Aligned local folder-selector copy with the hosted dashboard (`Run folder` / `Select Folder`) and
  hardened the native picker startup so a missing default folder falls back to the nearest existing
  directory.

## 2026-06-16 — Hosted static dashboard

- Added the GitHub Pages workflow (`.github/workflows/pages.yml`); Pages source set to **GitHub
  Actions** so the built React/Vite app is served instead of a Jekyll README page.
- Added static-mode local file loading (`browserData.js`): open the hosted dashboard, select a local
  run folder, and parse RMCProfile CSV/log/STOG outputs with no Python and no upload.
- Extended static mode to parse uploaded `.rmc6f`, populate the model summary, and render the slab
  projection + Three.js 3D view.
- Added `workers/localKdeWorker.js`: off-thread browser KDE capped at 6000 slab points, deterministic
  pseudo-random sampling, contour segments for the existing overlay.
- Kept Flask `/api/kde/slice` as the reference server-side SciPy path.

## 2026-06-15 — Palette and docs

- Three.js atom palette → Nature-style (Ga deep blue, Nb vermillion, Se teal).
- Refreshed `assets/rmc-toolkits-KDE.png`; updated README + frontend docs for the local preview flow.

## 2026-05-27 — UI refresh and interactive dashboard

- Bright/dark theme system via CSS variables with a persisted header toggle.
- Removed the sidebar-first workflow; header now hosts data-path input, Dashboard/KDE nav, and theme
  toggle. App defaults to the `data` path.
- Added `GET /api/plot/data` (parsed series + normalized scientific labels: `χ`, `Å`, `Q (Å⁻¹)`).
- Replaced PNG cards with `InteractivePlot.jsx` (SVG, hover readouts, legend toggles, integer x
  ticks, drag-to-zoom + reset). Simplified the Dashboard to a three-card grid.
- Reworked KDE/3D into three side-by-side panels (XY slice, slab x-z projection, Three.js model);
  2D panels preserve lattice aspect ratios. Added gray slab-edge outlines in the 3D model.

## 2026-05-27 — Real server-side KDE

- Added `rmc_toolkits/kde.py`: loads unit-cell-folded cartesian (Å) positions from a `.rmc6f`
  (optional element filter) and computes an XY `scipy.stats.gaussian_kde` density for a z-slab
  (ported from `src/RMC_KDE.py`). Returns plain arrays (grid, extent, contour polylines via
  `contourpy`, slab count, vmin/vmax); fit subsampled to 6000 points for slider responsiveness.
- Added `GET /api/kde/slice`. `z`/`dz` are cell-edge fractions converted to Å internally; loaded
  positions cached per (path, mtime, element) with `lru_cache`.
- Made the backend port configurable via `RMC_TOOLKITS_PORT` (default 5000).
- Replaced the browser box-blur "density" with the fetched real KDE grid (colormap LUT + contour
  overlay); fetches debounced with `AbortController`. Added bandwidth/colormap/grid/contour/log-scale
  controls and `colormaps.js`. Default z-slice auto-snaps to the densest band on load.
- Added `.venv/`, `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc` to `.gitignore`.

## 2026-05-27 — Package + tests foundation

- Added `rmc_toolkits/parsers.py` (RMC CSV/log/STOG, `.rmc6f`, `Frac*.txt`) and
  `write_frac_from_rmc6f` conversion.
- Added `rmc_toolkits/plots.py` (plot detection, figures, metrics, PNG serialization); backend now
  calls into the package instead of duplicating logic.
- Added backend endpoints: `/api/health`, `/api/files`, `/api/plot`, `/api/plot/metadata`,
  `/api/convert/frac`, `/api/structure`, `/api/kde/slice`; plus a data-root guard
  (`RMC_TOOLKITS_DATA_ROOT`).
- Frontend uses `VITE_API_BASE_URL` (default `http://localhost:5000`); file-path field no longer
  fires a request per keystroke.
- Added the Dashboard all-plots view and the KDE/3D page (element filter, z-slice controls, density
  KDE canvas, Three.js folded unit cell with OrbitControls + translucent slab overlay, and the
  slab-in-cell x-z projection).
- Fixed structure sampling so the sample renders all 52,000 atoms and preserves all 52 reference
  sites (sampling grouped by reference number, not raw stride).
- Added a `unittest` suite under `tests/` covering CSV/log parsing, Rwp, `.rmc6f` metadata +
  conversion, structure loading, plot detection/metadata/PNG, and KDE loading/slice.
